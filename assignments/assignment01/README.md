Create a **private** folder named `\assignments` and add me (`@DarioBoh`) as your collaborator. From now on, `\assignments` is the folder where you will submit your assignments. Please make sure you keep the folder private to comply with the University code of Conduct. Read [this article](http://www.lsunow.com/daily/lsu-student-faces-discipline-after-another-student-copies-work/article_68fda758-2715-11e8-a81d-0367ea24525b.html) to reflect on why you do not want to publicly share homework/assignments during the semester.
