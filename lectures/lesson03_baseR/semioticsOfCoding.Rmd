Many programming languages are similar between them, thus the following of concepts applies is not specific to R.

An algorithm is a finite set of instructions to follow for converging towards a final stage starting from some initial information. Convergence - when possible - is determined by a unique criterion.

Languages:

- machine code
- assembler
- high level programming language: FORTRAN, COBOL, LISP, PROLOG, PASCAL, JAVA
- low level programming language

Objects are hierarchically sorted in classes and subclasses. Methods are operations that an object of a specific class can execute (e.g., a *oven* can **turn on** or **check temperature**). The events that an object returns are output. Because classes are organized hierachically, properties from higher-level classes are inherited by subclasses.
